# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Vuyo Mkhatshwa

### Code Functionality and Requirements

- Your Python script in `main.py` correctly reads the CSV file, converts string data to integers, and aggregates statistics for each algorithm.
- You accurately calculate average happiness ratings and average session durations, identifying that JoyStream has the highest average happiness and DeepPulse the longest average session duration.
- The formatted print output in your code closely mirrors the provided example output, demonstrating that you met the functional requirements of the assignment.

### Report Content

- Your `report.md` file provides a clear introduction, methodology, detailed results, observations, and conclusions.
- You effectively describe how the data was processed and interpreted, and you offer insights by noting the anomaly with DeepPulse despite its low happiness rating.
- The report is professional and well-organized. There is a minor extraneous character ("4") in the Introduction section that could be removed for clarity, but it does not detract from the overall quality.

### Overall Evaluation

- You have successfully met the project requirements by implementing file I/O, data parsing, statistical calculations, and producing a well-formatted report.
- Your approach is clear and demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts taught in the assignment.
- Excellent workâ€”keep up the great work and continue to refine your documentation for even greater clarity.
