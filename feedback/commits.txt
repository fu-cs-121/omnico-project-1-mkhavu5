 ## Introduction
 
-[Provide a brief overview of the project objectives and the importance of the analysis.]
+This report analyzes user data for OmniCo's three algorithms; JoyStream, SerenityFlow, and DeepPulse. The objective is to understand user behavior and satisfaction across these algorithms, providing insights for future development and optimization. By evaluating average happiness ratings and session durations, we aim to identify the most effective algorithms and areas for improvement for each.

 ## Methodology
 
-[Describe the steps you took to perform the analysis, including any calculations and reasoning behind them.]
+The analysis involved processing data from a CSV file ("euphoria_data.csv"). The code first initialized a dictionary to store statistics for each algorithm, including total happiness ratings, total session durations, and session counts. It then read the CSV file, parsed each line, and summed the data. The Average happiness and session duration were also calculated for each algorithm by dividing using the number of session run in each algorithm (session_counts). Finally, the algorithms with the highest average happiness and longest average session duration were identified.
 
 ## Results
 
 - **Average Happiness Rating per Algorithm**
 
-  - JoyStream: ...
-  - SerenityFlow: ...
-  - DeepPulse: ...
+  - JoyStream: 8.50
+  - SerenityFlow: 7.00
+  - DeepPulse: 5.00
 
 - **Total Number of Sessions per Algorithm**
 
-  - JoyStream: ...
-  - SerenityFlow: ...
-  - DeepPulse: ...
+  - JoyStream: 4
+  - SerenityFlow: 3
+  - DeepPulse: 3
 
 - **Average Session Duration per Algorithm**
 
-  - JoyStream: ... minutes
-  - SerenityFlow: ... minutes
-  - DeepPulse: ... minutes
+  - JoyStream: 37.50 minutes
+  - SerenityFlow: 30.00 minutes
+  - DeepPulse: 45.00 minutes
 
 - **Highest and Lowest Performers**
-  - Highest Average Happiness Rating: ...
-  - Longest Average Session Duration: ...
+  - Highest Average Happiness Rating: 8.50
+  - Longest Average Session Duration: 45.00 minutes
 
 ## Observations and Insights
 
-[Discuss any patterns, anomalies, or noteworthy findings from your analysis. Include any ethical considerations or unexpected results, especially related to the DeepPulse algorithm.]
+Typically we would expect to see the algorithm with the highest happiness rating be correlated with longer session duration which we can see with the JoyStream and SerenityFlow algorithms respectively, however we also observe an anomaly, specifically with the DeepPulse algorithm. Despite having the lowest average happiness rating, the DeepPulse algorithm produced the longest average session duration, which was unexpected.
 
 ## Conclusions and Recommendations
 
-[Summarize your conclusions based on the results. Provide any recommendations for next steps or further analysis.]
+In conclusion, JoyStream appears as the most successful algorithm based on user happiness, while SerenityFlow shows moderate performance in both happiness and session duration. DeepPulse, while having the lowest average happiness, has the longest average session duration, which is cause for further exploration. looking at session counts for each algorithm, there were too few observations and data in the euphoria data file to be able to achieve any statistically significant results, hence I would suggest collecting more data as a future recommendation. This could also help with my next recommendation, of exploring whether the anomal result found with the DeepPulse algorithm was an outlier or if another variable is in play manipulating the result.

+
+---
+
+## 1. Reading and Writing Files
+
+### Reading Files
+
+To process data stored in files, you'll need to read the file content into your program.
+
+**Example: Reading a file line by line**
+
+```python
+# Open the file in read mode
+with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
+    # Iterate over each line in the file
+    for line in file:
+        # Process the line
+        print(line)
+```
+
+- **Note:** Using `with open()` ensures the file is properly closed after its contents have been processed.
+
+### Skipping Header Rows
+
+When reading CSV files, you might need to skip the header row.
+
+**Example: Skipping the header**
+
+```python
+with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
+    # Read the header line
+    header = file.readline()
+    # Process the remaining lines
+    for line in file:
+        # Process the line
+        print(line)
+```
+
+### Reading and Processing CSV Files
+
+Often, data is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. You can read and process CSV files by splitting each line into fields.
+
+**Example: Reading a CSV file and processing data**
+
+```python
+# Open the CSV file
+with open('employees.csv', 'r') as file:
+    # Read and discard the header line
+    header = file.readline()
+    # Process each line in the file
+    for line in file:
+        # Remove leading/trailing whitespace characters (including newline)
+        line = line.strip()
+        # Split the line into a list of values based on commas
+        fields = line.split(',')
+        # Access individual fields
+        employee_id = fields[0]
+        name = fields[1]
+        department = fields[2]
+        salary = fields[3]
+        # Output the processed data
+        print(f"ID: {employee_id}, Name: {name}, Department: {department}, Salary: {salary}")
+```
+
+**Sample `employees.csv` content:**
+
+```
+EmployeeID,Name,Department,Salary
+E001,Alice Smith,Sales,75000
+E002,Bob Johnson,Engineering,82000
+E003,Charlie Lee,Marketing,68000
+```
+
+**Output of the code:**
+
+```
+ID: E001, Name: Alice Smith, Department: Sales, Salary: 75000
+ID: E002, Name: Bob Johnson, Department: Engineering, Salary: 82000
+ID: E003, Name: Charlie Lee, Department: Marketing, Salary: 68000
+```
+
+- **Explanation:**
+  - `line.strip()` removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including newline characters.
+  - `fields = line.split(',')` splits the line into a list of values.
+  - `fields[0]` accesses the first element in the list (EmployeeID).
+  - `fields[1:]` accesses elements from index 1 to the end (Name, Department, Salary).
+
+### Slicing Lists
+
+You can access specific parts of a list using slicing.
+
+**Example: Accessing parts of a list**
+
+```python
+fields = ['E001', 'Alice Smith', 'Sales', '75000']
+
+# Access the first field
+employee_id = fields[0]  # 'E001'
+
+# Access all fields except the first
+other_fields = fields[1:]  # ['Alice Smith', 'Sales', '75000']
+```
+
+- **Explanation:**
+  - `fields[0]` retrieves the first item in the list.
+  - `fields[1:]` slices the list from index 1 to the end.
+
+### Writing Files
+
+To output data or results to a file, you can write to a file using the following pattern:
+
+**Example: Writing data to a file**
+
+```python
+# Open the file in write mode
+with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
+    # Write data to the file
+    file.write('Hello, OmniCo!\n')
+    file.write('Data analysis complete.')
+```
+
+---
+
+## 2. String Manipulation
+
+### Stripping Whitespace
+
+When reading lines from a file, you may need to remove extra whitespace characters like newline (`\n`).
+
+**Example: Removing trailing whitespace**
+
+```python
+line = line.strip()
+```
+
+### Splitting Strings
+
+To break a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter (e.g., commas in a CSV file), use the `split()` method.
+
+**Example: Splitting a comma-separated string**
+
+```python
+data = 'apple,banana,cherry'
+fruits = data.split(',')  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
+```
+
+### Converting Strings to Numbers
+
+Data read from files is often in string format. To perform calculations, convert strings to integers or floats.
+
+**Example: Converting strings to numeric types**
+
+```python
+number_str = '42'
+number_int = int(number_str)      # 42 as an integer
+number_float = float(number_str)  # 42.0 as a float
+```
+
+---
+
+## 3. Working with Data Structures
+
+### Lists
+
+A list is an ordered collection of items.
+
+**Example: Creating and accessing a list**
+
+```python
+# Create a list of departments
+departments = ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing', 'HR']
+
+# Access the first department
+first_department = departments[0]  # 'Sales'
+
+# Access departments from index 1 to the end
+remaining_departments = departments[1:]  # ['Engineering', 'Marketing', 'HR']
+```
+
+### Sorting Lists
+
+You can sort lists in ascending or descending order using the `sort()` method or the `sorted()` function.
+
+**Example: Sorting a list of numbers**
+
+```python
+# List of numbers
+numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
+
+# Sort the list in ascending order
+numbers.sort()
+print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
+
+# Alternatively, using sorted()
+numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
+sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
+print(sorted_numbers)  # [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
+```
+
+**Example: Sorting a list of strings**
+
+```python
+# List of department names
+departments = ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing', 'HR']
+
+# Sort the list alphabetically
+departments.sort()
+print(departments)  # ['Engineering', 'HR', 'Marketing', 'Sales']
+```
+
+**Sorting in Descending Order**
+
+Use the `reverse=True` parameter to sort in descending order.
+
+```python
+numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
+numbers.sort(reverse=True)
+print(numbers)  # [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]
+```
+
+### Dictionaries
+
+A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.
+
+**Example: Creating and using a dictionary**
+
+```python
+# Create a dictionary of employee IDs and names
+employees = {
+    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
+    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
+    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
+}
+
+# Access a value by key
+employee_name = employees['E001']  # 'Alice Smith'
+```
+
+### Sorting Dictionaries
+
+By default, dictionaries in Python 3.7+ maintain insertion order. If you want to get sorted keys or values from a dictionary, you can create a sorted list.
+
+**Example: Sorting dictionary keys**
+
+```python
+# Get a list of sorted employee IDs
+sorted_employee_ids = sorted(employees.keys())
+print(sorted_employee_ids)  # ['E001', 'E002', 'E003']
+```
+
+**Example: Sorting dictionary values**
+
+```python
+# Get a list of sorted employee names
+sorted_employee_names = sorted(employees.values())
+print(sorted_employee_names)  # ['Alice Smith', 'Bob Johnson', 'Charlie Lee']
+```
+
+### Nested Dictionaries
+
+Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values.
+
+**Example: Nested dictionary**
+
+```python
+# Create a dictionary of employees with their details
+employees = {
+    'E001': {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000},
+    'E002': {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 82000},
+    'E003': {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000}
+}
+
+# Access nested values
+alice_department = employees['E001']['department']  # 'Sales'
+```
+
+### Sorting a List of Dictionaries by a Key
+
+If you have a list of dictionaries and want to sort it based on a specific key, you can use the `sorted()` function with a `key` parameter.
+
+**Example: Sorting a list of dictionaries by salary**
+
+```python
+# List of employee dictionaries
+employee_list = [
+    {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000},
+    {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 82000},
+    {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000}
+]
+
+# Sort the list by salary in ascending order
+sorted_employee_list = sorted(employee_list, key=lambda x: x['salary'])
+
+# Print the sorted list
+for employee in sorted_employee_list:
+    print(f"{employee['name']}: ${employee['salary']}")
+```
+
+**Output:**
+
+```
+Charlie Lee: $68000
+Alice Smith: $75000
+Bob Johnson: $82000
+```
+
+- **Explanation:**
+  - `sorted()` takes the list and a `key` function that tells it how to compare items.
+  - `key=lambda x: x['salary']` means we sort based on the `'salary'` key in each dictionary.
+
+**Sorting in Descending Order**
+
+To sort the list in descending order, add `reverse=True`:
+
+```python
+# Sort the list by salary in descending order
+sorted_employee_list = sorted(employee_list, key=lambda x: x['salary'], reverse=True)
+```
+
+### Updating Nested Dictionaries
+
+You can update values within a nested dictionary by specifying the keys in sequence.
+
+**Example: Updating a nested dictionary**
+
+```python
+# Update Bob's salary
+employees['E002']['salary'] = 85000
+
+# Add a new key-value pair to Charlie's details
+employees['E003']['email'] = 'charlie.lee@omnico.com'
+```
+
+- **Note:** If the key does not exist, it will be added to the dictionary.
+
+### Extracting Keys and Values as Lists
+
+You can extract all the keys or values from a dictionary and convert them into a list.
+
+**Example: Getting a list of employee IDs**
+
+```python
+# Get a list of employee IDs
+employee_ids = list(employees.keys())  # ['E001', 'E002', 'E003']
+```
+
+---
+
+## 4. Control Flow Statements
+
+### If Statements
+
+Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.
+
+**Example: Checking employee performance**
+
+```python
+sales = 120000
+
+if sales >= 100000:
+    print('Excellent performance')
+elif sales >= 70000:
+    print('Good performance')
+else:
+    print('Needs improvement')
+```
+
+---
+
+## 5. Loops and Iteration
+
+### For Loops
+
+Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences like lists or dictionaries.
+
+**Example: Iterating over a list**
+
+```python
+departments = ['Sales', 'Engineering', 'Marketing']
+
+for dept in departments:
+    print(dept)
+```
+
+### Iterating Over Dictionaries
+
+When iterating over dictionaries, you can access keys and values.
+
+**Example: Iterating over dictionary items**
+
+```python
+employees = {
+    'E001': 'Alice Smith',
+    'E002': 'Bob Johnson',
+    'E003': 'Charlie Lee'
+}
+
+for emp_id, name in employees.items():
+    print(f'ID: {emp_id}, Name: {name}')
+```
+
+### Looping Through Nested Dictionaries and Computing Values
+
+You can loop through a nested dictionary to perform calculations and update the dictionary.
+
+**Example: Calculating bonuses and adding them to the dictionary**
+
+```python
+# Existing nested dictionary of employees and their salaries
+employees = {
+    'E001': {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000},
+    'E002': {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 85000},
+    'E003': {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000}
+}
+
+# Loop through each employee to calculate bonuses
+for emp_id, details in employees.items():
+    salary = details['salary']
+    # Calculate bonus: 10% of salary
+    bonus = salary * 0.10
+    # Add the bonus to the employee's details
+    details['bonus'] = bonus
+
+# The employees dictionary now includes the bonus amount
+print(employees)
+```
+
+**Output:**
+
+```python
+{
+    'E001': {'name': 'Alice Smith', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 75000, 'bonus': 7500.0},
+    'E002': {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'department': 'Engineering', 'salary': 85000, 'bonus': 8500.0},
+    'E003': {'name': 'Charlie Lee', 'department': 'Marketing', 'salary': 68000, 'bonus': 6800.0}
+}
+```
+
+- **Explanation:**
+  - For each employee, we calculated a bonus equal to 10% of their salary.
+  - We added a new key `'bonus'` to each employee's dictionary.
+
+### While Loops
+
+Use `while` loops to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
+
+**Example: Using a while loop**
+
+```python
+count = 0
+while count < 5:
+    print(f'Count is {count}')
+    count += 1
+```
+
+### Using Break Statements
+
+The `break` statement exits the nearest enclosing loop.
+
+**Example: Exiting a loop early**
+
+```python
+for number in range(10):
+    if number == 5:
+        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5
+    print(number)
+```
+
+---
+
+## 6. Performing Calculations
+
+### Basic Arithmetic Operations
+
+You can perform arithmetic operations using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
+
+**Example: Calculating the average salary**
+
+```python
+total_salary = 228000
+number_of_employees = 3
+average_salary = total_salary / number_of_employees  # 76000.0
+```
+
+### Using min() and max() Functions
+
+The `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest of the input values, respectively.
+
+**Example: Limiting salary increases**
+
+```python
+increase = 5000
+max_increase = 4000
+adjusted_increase = min(increase, max_increase)  # adjusted_increase is 4000
+```
+
+**Example: Ensuring a minimum bonus**
+
+```python
+bonus = 2000
+min_bonus = 2500
+adjusted_bonus = max(bonus, min_bonus)  # adjusted_bonus is 2500
+```
+
+### Calculating Percentage Increases
+
+**Example: Calculating the percentage increase in sales**
+
+```python
+previous_sales = 100000
+current_sales = 125000
+increase = current_sales - previous_sales
+percentage_increase = (increase / previous_sales) * 100  # 25.0%
+```
+
+### Avoiding Division by Zero
+
+Always ensure the denominator is not zero before dividing.
+
+**Example: Safe division**
+
+```python
+if number_of_employees != 0:
+    average_salary = total_salary / number_of_employees
+else:
+    average_salary = 0  # Handle the zero division case appropriately
+```
+
+### Casting Values During Calculations
+
+When performing calculations that result in float values, you may need to cast them to integers.
+
+**Example: Converting a float to an integer**
+
+```python
+value = 76.75
+integer_value = int(value)  # 76
+```
+
+- **Note:** Casting to `int` truncates the decimal part.
+
+---
+
+## 7. Formatting and Printing Output
+
+### Using the Print Function
+
+Display information using the `print()` function.
+
+**Example: Printing a message**
+
+```python
+print('Welcome to OmniCo!')
+```
+
+### String Formatting
+
+Format strings to include variables and control numeric precision.
+
+**Example: Using f-strings**
+
+```python
+name = 'Alice'
+salary = 75000
+
+print(f'{name} has a salary of ${salary:.2f}')  # 'Alice has a salary of $75000.00'
+```
+
+- `:.2f` formats the number to two decimal places.
+
+### Formatting Strings for Files
+
+When writing formatted data to a file, you can use f-strings and special characters like `\n` (newline) and `\t` (tab).
+
+**Example: Writing formatted text to a file**
+
+```python
+with open('employee_report.txt', 'w') as file:
+    file.write('Employee Report\n')
+    file.write('---------------\n')
+    file.write('ID\tName\t\t\tDepartment\tSalary\n')
+    for emp_id, data in employees.items():
+        line = f"{emp_id}\t{data['name']}\t{data['department']}\t${data['salary']}\n"
+        file.write(line)
+```
+
+### Aligning Text Output
+
+You can use formatting options to align text and numbers.
+
+**Example: Formatting with alignment**
+
+```python
+# Left-align text and format numbers with precision
+line = f"{emp_id:<5}{data['name']:<20}{data['department']:<15}${data['salary']:>10.2f}\n"
+```
+
+- `<` : Left-align within the available space.
+- `>` : Right-align within the available space.
+- `.2f` : Format the number with two decimal places.
+
+---
+
+## 8. Error Handling
+
+### Handling Exceptions
+
+Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle potential errors.
+
+**Example: Handling ValueError**
+
+```python
+value = 'abc'
+
+try:
+    number = int(value)
+except ValueError:
+    print('Cannot convert to integer.')
+```
+
+---
+
+## 9. Best Practices
+
+### Writing Readable Code
+
+- Use meaningful variable names.
+- Keep code organized and properly indented.
+- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
+
+### Commenting Your Code
+
+- Add comments to explain non-obvious parts of your code.
+- Keep comments concise and relevant.
+
+**Example:**
+
+```python
+# Calculate the average salary
+average_salary = total_salary / number_of_employees
+```
+
+#### Commenting Complex Logic
+
+When implementing complex algorithms or logic, add comments to explain the steps.
+
+**Example: Explaining a bonus calculation algorithm**
+
+```python
+# Loop through each employee to calculate bonuses
+for emp_id, details in employees.items():
+    salary = details['salary']
+    # Calculate bonus as 10% of salary
+    bonus = salary * 0.10
+    # Add the bonus to the employee's details
+    details['bonus'] = bonus
+```
+
+### Following Style Guidelines
+
+- Use consistent naming conventions (`snake_case` for variables and functions).
+- Avoid overly long lines; keep them under 80 characters when possible.
+- Separate code into logical sections with blank lines.
+
+---
+
+## 10. Additional Tips
+
+### Testing Your Code
+
+- Regularly test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.
+
+### Debugging
+
+- Use print statements or a debugger to trace and fix issues.
+
+### Asking for Help
+
+- If you're stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to a peer or mentor.
+
+### Handling Data Carefully
+
+- Be cautious when manipulating data to avoid unintended consequences.
+- Ensure that you understand the data structure before performing operations.

+<div style="padding:20px 40px;">
+Dear {{user.first_name}},
+
+Welcome to your first day at OmniCo! I hope you're settling in well.
+
+I have an important task for you regarding our social VR platform, **Euphoria**. We've recently implemented three different content feed algorithms to see how they affect user engagement and mood:
+
+- **JoyStream**: Focuses on positive and uplifting content
+- **SerenityFlow**: Delivers calming and peaceful experiences
+- **DeepPulse**: Presents a wider range of emotional content
+
+We've collected data from user sessions with each algorithm, and I'd like you to analyze this information to help us understand which algorithm is performing best.
+
+I've added a data file called `euphoria_data.csv` to your repository. It contains information about each user session, including which algorithm was used, how long the session lasted, and the user's happiness rating after the session.
+
+Please analyze this data and prepare a report with your findings. We're particularly interested in which algorithm produces the highest happiness ratings and which one keeps users engaged for the longest time.
+
+Looking forward to your insights!
+
+Best regards,
+
+Sophia Lewis
+Lead Research Analyst
+OmniVerse Division, OmniCo

+# Project Instructions
+
+In this assignment, you'll work with a real-world scenario where you need to analyze data to help make business decisions. You'll practice new skills including:
+
+- Reading data from CSV files
+- Processing and analyzing the data
+- Calculating statistics
+- Presenting findings in a professional format
+
+## Learning Objectives
+
+- Understand how to read and parse data from files
+- Apply programming concepts to solve real data problems
+- Calculate and interpret basic statistics
+- Present findings effectively
+
+## Getting Started
+
+1. **Set Up Your Project**
+
+   - Clone the repository from the [classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/2DJMmKAd)
+   - Open a new window in VSCode (File > New Window)
+   - Click the Source Panel (branch icon) and then "Clone Repository"
+   - Paste in the URL and select a location to save the repository
+   - Open the repository folder in VSCode
+   - Add your name to the top part of your `report.md` and commit/push it back to Github
+
+2. **Understanding the Data**
+   - The file `euphoria_data.csv` contains the following columns:
+     - `user_id`: A unique identifier for each user
+     - `algorithm`: Which content algorithm was used (JoyStream, SerenityFlow, or DeepPulse)
+     - `session_duration`: How long the user session lasted, in minutes
+     - `happiness_rating`: The user's self-reported happiness rating after the session (1-10 scale)
+
+## Step-by-Step Tutorial
+
+### Step 1: Understanding File I/O in Python
+
+In Python, we can read data from files using the `open()` function. For CSV files, we typically:
+
+1. Open the file
+2. Read each line
+3. Process the data in each line
+4. Close the file when finished
+
+Here's how we open and read a file:
+
+```python
+# Open the file in read mode ('r')
+with open('filename.csv', 'r') as file:
+    # The 'with' statement automatically closes the file when the block ends
+
+    # Read the header line (column names)
+    header = file.readline()
+
+    # Read the rest of the lines
+    for line in file:
+        # Process each line here
+        print(line)  # This will print each line with newline characters
+
+        # To remove whitespace and newline characters:
+        clean_line = line.strip()
+        print(clean_line)
+```
+
+### Step 2: Parsing CSV Data
+
+CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files store data as text with values separated by commas. To parse each line:
+
+```python
+# Split the line into values using comma as separator
+columns = line.split(',')
+
+# Now 'columns' is a list containing each value from the line
+# For example, if line is "101,JoyStream,45,8", then:
+# columns[0] would be "101" (user_id)
+# columns[1] would be "JoyStream" (algorithm)
+# columns[2] would be "45" (session_duration)
+# columns[3] would be "8" (happiness_rating)
+```
+
+### Step 3: Converting String Values to Numbers
+
+Values read from a file are always strings, even if they represent numbers. To perform calculations, we need to convert them to numeric types:
+
+```python
+# Convert string to integer
+session_duration = int(columns[2])
+
+# Convert string to float (for decimal numbers)
+happiness_rating = int(columns[3])
+```
+
+### Step 4: Organizing Data with Dictionaries
+
+We'll use dictionaries to store and organize our data by algorithm:
+
+```python
+# Initialize a dictionary to store statistics for each algorithm
+stats = {
+    'JoyStream': {
+        'total_happiness': 0,
+        'total_duration': 0,
+        'session_count': 0
+    },
+    'SerenityFlow': {
+        'total_happiness': 0,
+        'total_duration': 0,
+        'session_count': 0
+    },
+    'DeepPulse': {
+        'total_happiness': 0,
+        'total_duration': 0,
+        'session_count': 0
+    }
+}
+```
+
+### Step 5: Your Task - Complete the Program
+
+Now, your job is to complete the provided Python program to:
+
+1. Read the CSV data
+2. Calculate statistics for each algorithm
+3. Determine which algorithm has the highest happiness rating and longest average session duration
